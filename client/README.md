## Client README

After sending the high entropy packets and before starting the post probing phase the client sleeps for 6 seconds. This is to give the server time to receive the packets and start the post probing phase. The number of seconds was chosen by arbitrarily.

The final verdict is shown on the client console during the post probing phase and then the program terminates.
