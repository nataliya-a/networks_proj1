# Part I: Server-Client

## Requirements
'make' is required to build the project.

## Build
To build and run the project, run the following command in the project directory:
```
cd server
make start
```
```
cd client
make start
```

If everything goes well, you should see the following output:
```
Server is running on port 8080
```
```
Please give server a few moments to start up before starting the client.

## Result
The final verdict will be printed to the client console.
